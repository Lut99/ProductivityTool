# ProductivityTool
The ProductivityTool is an app that is designed to easily plan your day and help you to work effeciently and in an structured way. It revolves around a task-based planning of your day, in which you specify which tasks are needed to be done on which day and how long you estimate to be working on them. Time is here divided into so-called 'Units' of equal length, which should represent one work / break cycle. This tool is meant to help you organise which task to do when and to give you an overview of your schedule in terms of these tasks. Additionally, the Tool will also automate some things like automatically moving unfinished tasks up and providing a timer to help you work in the Units.

If you are interested in a more detailed list of features, tutorials or code documentation, please refer to the Wiki in this repository.

## Public Usage
While this project is mainly for private usage, feel free to use the tool yourself and potentially alter it to your heart's content. If you use the tool for commercial ends, please leave a link to this repository and make sure to make any changes you make public. For private use, you're allowed to change whatever you wish without sharing it with the world :)

If you're not a coder and want some things to change, consider creating an issue with the 'Suggestion' tag, and then I'll take it into consideration. However, since it's for private use, I might decide not to include it based on opinion alone.
